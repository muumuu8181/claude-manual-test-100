Test 4: Directory Organization and File Categorization

Instructions:
Organize files by performing each step individually:

1. Create three directories: "documents", "images", and "data"
2. Create a file "readme.txt" in documents with content: "Document storage area"
3. Create a file "photo1.jpg" in images with content: "Image file 1"
4. Create a file "dataset.csv" in data with content: "name,age,city"
5. Create a file "temp.log" in the main directory with content: "Temporary log file"
6. Move temp.log to the documents directory and rename it to "system.log"
7. Create a copy of readme.txt in the main directory named "info.txt"
8. Create a summary file "inventory.txt" listing all files and their locations
9. Create subdirectories "archived" in each of the three main directories
10. Create a final report "organization_complete.txt" confirming the directory structure

Requirements:
- Create each directory and file individually
- Perform file operations one at a time
