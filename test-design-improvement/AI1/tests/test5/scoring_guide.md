### Accuracy Requirements:
- **Mathematical Precision** (Deduct 3 points per error): All calculations must be exact
- **Individual Processing** (Deduct 15 points): Using automated calculations instead of manual
- **Comparison Logic** (Deduct 5 points per error): Highest/lowest identification must be manual
- **Data Reading** (Deduct 5 points): Must read each product value individually

### Process Evaluation:
- **Manual Calculations** (Deduct 20 points): Using formulas or scripts instead of individual calculations
- **Verification Steps** (Deduct 5 points): Not verifying calculations before saving
- **File Organization** (Deduct 3 points per error): Files not created as specified

### Bonus Considerations:
- **Systematic Approach** (+5 points): Clear evidence of step-by-step manual processing
- **Calculation Verification** (+5 points): Shows verification of mathematical operations
