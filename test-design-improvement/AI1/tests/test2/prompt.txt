Test 2: Data Processing and Calculation

Instructions:
Perform these calculations and file operations individually:

1. Create a file named "numbers.txt" containing the values: 15, 23, 7, 89, 34 (one per line)
2. Read the first number (15) and multiply it by 3, save result to "calc1.txt"
3. Read the second number (23) and add 17 to it, save result to "calc2.txt"
4. Read the third number (7) and calculate 7^2, save result to "calc3.txt"
5. Read the fourth number (89) and subtract 25 from it, save result to "calc4.txt"
6. Read the fifth number (34) and divide it by 2, save result to "calc5.txt"
7. Create a file "summary.txt" that contains the text "Calculations completed for 5 numbers"
8. Read all calc files and manually sum their results, save the total to "total.txt"
9. Create a verification file "check.txt" containing the original numbers and their corresponding results

Requirements:
- Perform each calculation individually (no loops or scripts)
- Read each number separately from the source file
- Save each calculation result to its own file
- Manually verify calculations before saving
