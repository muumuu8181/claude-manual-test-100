   - numbers.txt created with correct values in correct format

2. **Calculation 1** (10 points)
   - 15 × 3 = 45 correctly calculated and saved to calc1.txt

3. **Calculation 2** (10 points)
   - 23 + 17 = 40 correctly calculated and saved to calc2.txt

4. **Calculation 3** (10 points)
   - 7² = 49 correctly calculated and saved to calc3.txt

5. **Calculation 4** (10 points)

### Accuracy Requirements:
- **Mathematical Precision** (Deduct 5 points per error): All calculations must be correct
- **File Reading** (Deduct 3 points per error): Each number read individually from source
- **Individual Processing** (Deduct 10 points): No automated calculations or loops used

### Bonus Points:
- **Verification Process** (+5 points): Shows verification of calculations before saving
- **Organization** (+5 points): Logical approach to reading and processing each number
