### Accuracy Requirements:
- **Grade Conversion Logic** (Deduct 5 points per error): Must use correct grade scale
- **Manual Calculations** (Deduct 15 points): Using automated calculations instead of manual
- **Individual Processing** (Deduct 10 points): Not converting each grade individually
- **Counting Accuracy** (Deduct 5 points per error): Grade counts must be exact

### Process Evaluation:
- **Step-by-Step Execution** (Deduct 10 points): Not completing each conversion individually
- **Comparison Method** (Deduct 10 points): Not manually comparing scores for highest/lowest
- **GPA Logic** (Deduct 15 points): Incorrect grade point values or calculation method

### Bonus Points:
- **Comprehensive Analysis** (+5 points): Detailed performance analysis with clear explanations
- **Calculation Verification** (+5 points): Shows verification of mathematical operations
- **Systematic Organization** (+5 points): Logical progression through all analysis steps
