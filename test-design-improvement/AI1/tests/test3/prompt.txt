Test 3: Text Processing and File Manipulation

Instructions:
Complete each text processing task individually:

1. Create a file "source.txt" containing: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
2. Extract the word "quick" and save it to "word1.txt"
3. Extract the word "brown" and save it to "word2.txt" 
4. Extract the word "jumps" and save it to "word3.txt"
5. Count the total number of characters in source.txt (including spaces) and save to "char_count.txt"
6. Count the total number of words in source.txt and save to "word_count.txt"
7. Create "reversed.txt" containing the source text written backwards (character by character)
8. Create "uppercase.txt" containing the source text in all capital letters
9. Create "report.txt" summarizing: original text, character count, word count, and confirmation of file creation

Requirements:
- Extract each word individually (not using automated text processing)
- Perform character and word counting manually
- Create each output file separately
- Verify content of each file after creation
