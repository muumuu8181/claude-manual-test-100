Test 1: Basic File Management Operations

Instructions:
Please perform the following tasks in sequence. Each step must be completed individually.

1. Create a new directory called "workspace" in the current test directory
2. Inside workspace, create a file named "data.txt" containing the text "Initial data"
3. Create another file named "config.json" in workspace with content: {"version": 1, "active": true}
4. Copy data.txt to create a backup file named "data_backup.txt" in the same directory
5. Create a subdirectory called "archive" inside workspace
6. Move data_backup.txt into the archive directory
7. List all files in the workspace directory and save the output to "file_list.txt"
8. Read the contents of config.json and append ", read: true" to the end (making it invalid JSON intentionally)

Requirements:
- Complete each step exactly as described
- Do not use loops or automation scripts
- Each file operation must be performed individually
- Verify each step before proceeding to the next
