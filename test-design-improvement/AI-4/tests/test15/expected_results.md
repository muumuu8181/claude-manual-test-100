## Key Validation Points

1. **Branch Management**: Three branches (main, feature/user-auth, hotfix/security-patch) with proper metadata
2. **Commit Tracking**: Five commits with proper parent-child relationships and metadata
3. **Merge Operations**: Two successful merges (fast-forward and three-way with conflict resolution)
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Proper detection, marking, and resolution of merge conflicts
5. **File Evolution**: app.py must contain both security and authentication methods in final state
6. **State Consistency**: repo_config.json must accurately track all operations and current state
7. **Tag Management**: v1.1.0 tag with proper metadata and snapshot of release state
8. **Directory Structure**: Proper organization with 18 directories and 30 files total
9. **JSON Validity**: All JSON configuration and metadata files must be syntactically valid
10. **Branch Synchronization**: All branch states must be consistent with their respective commits
11. **Merge History**: Proper tracking of merge commits with multiple parent references
12. **Rollback Preparation**: Rollback simulation infrastructure properly set up
