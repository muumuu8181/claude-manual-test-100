## Common Deduction Scenarios

1. **Branch management failures:** Deduct full point for incorrect branch creation, copying, or metadata tracking
2. **Merge operation errors:** Deduct full point for incorrect conflict detection, resolution, or merge completion
3. **File evolution inconsistencies:** Deduct full point if app.py doesn't contain both methods in final state
4. **State tracking failures:** Deduct full point for incorrect commit counting, branch tracking, or repository state
5. **JSON validity:** Deduct full point for any syntactically invalid JSON configuration files
6. **Content accuracy:** Deduct full point for files with incorrect modifications or missing changes
7. **Conflict resolution failures:** Deduct full point for improper conflict marking or resolution

## Critical Validation Points

1. **Multi-Branch Workflow:** Three active branches with proper independent development
2. **Merge Strategy:** Correct implementation of fast-forward and three-way merges
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Proper detection, marking, and resolution of merge conflicts in app.py
4. **File Evolution:** app.py must evolve correctly through branches and merges
5. **State Consistency:** repo_config.json must accurately track all repository operations
6. **Commit Lineage:** Proper parent-child relationships between commits including merge commits
7. **Tag Management:** Release tag with proper metadata and code snapshot
8. **Branch Synchronization:** All branch states must be consistent with their respective commits
9. **Directory Structure:** Proper organization with 18 directories and 30 files total
10. **JSON Validity:** All JSON files must be syntactically valid and contain accurate data

## Validation Commands

To verify version control simulation and branching workflow:
```bash
# Check final main branch state
grep -A5 "def authenticate" version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/branches/main/app.py
grep -A3 "def secure_hash" version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/branches/main/app.py

# Verify all JSON files are valid
find version_control_system -name "*.json" -exec python -m json.tool {} \;

# Check commit lineage and merge history
cat version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/commits/commit_004/commit_metadata.json | grep -A3 "parent_commits"

# Verify branch metadata consistency
ls version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/branches/*/branch_metadata.json | xargs grep -l "active"

# Check conflict resolution success
diff version_control_system/merge_operations/merge_feature_to_main/conflict_resolution/app.py.resolved version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/branches/main/app.py

# Verify repository state tracking
cat version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/repo_config.json | grep -E '"total_commits"|"active_branches"|"repository_state"'

# Check tag content matches main branch
diff version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/branches/main/app.py version_control_system/repositories/main_repo/tags/v1.1.0/app.py
```

Expected final count:
- Directories: 18 total (1 empty: repository_backup)
- Files: 30 total

- Branch files: 12 (3 files × 3 branches + metadata)
- Commit records: 8 (2 files × 4 commits)
- Tag files: 4 (metadata + 3 source files)
- Merge operation files: 6 (analysis, commits, conflict resolution)
- Branches managed: 3 (main, feature/user-auth, hotfix/security-patch)
- Merges completed: 2 (1 fast-forward, 1 three-way with conflict)
- Tags created: 1 (v1.1.0 release)
