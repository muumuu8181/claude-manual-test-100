# Verify YAML files are valid
find deployment_system -name "*.yaml" -exec python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('{}'))" \;

# Verify JSON files are valid
find deployment_system -name "*.json" -exec python -m json.tool {} \;

# Check deployment progression
grep -r "v1.0.0" deployment_system/environments/production/env_config.json  # Should show rollback
grep -r "v1.1.0" deployment_system/environments/staging/env_config.json   # Should show successful deployment
