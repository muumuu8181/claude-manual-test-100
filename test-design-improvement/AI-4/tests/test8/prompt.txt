You are tasked with performing mixed operations including dependencies, conditional operations, and simple error handling cases. This test combines various operation types with realistic scenarios.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Execute steps in exact sequential order (1 through 20)
2. Handle conditional operations based on file existence
3. Follow dependencies carefully - some steps depend on success of previous steps
4. Use exact names and paths as specified
5. Do not optimize or combine steps with loops
6. Pay attention to error handling instructions

**STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

Step 1: Create a directory named "workspace"
Step 2: Create a file named "input.txt" with content: "start"
Step 3: Create a file named "config.json" inside the "workspace" directory
Step 4: Read the content of "input.txt" and create a file named "[content]_process.txt" (use content for filename)
Step 5: Create a directory named "temp" inside the "workspace" directory
Step 6: Move "start_process.txt" into the "workspace/temp" directory
Step 7: Check if file "missing_file.txt" exists. If it does NOT exist, create a file named "error_log.txt" with content: "file_not_found"
Step 8: Create a file named "data.txt" with content: "processing"
Step 9: Read the content of "data.txt" and create a directory named "[content]_dir" (use content for directory name)
Step 10: Create a file named "status.txt" inside the "processing_dir" directory (from Step 9)
Step 11: Rename "config.json" in workspace to "settings.json"
Step 12: Copy "error_log.txt" into the "workspace" directory (if it exists from Step 7)
Step 13: Create a file named "output.txt" with content: "complete"
Step 14: Check if "workspace/settings.json" exists. If it exists, create a file named "validation_passed.txt"
Step 15: Move "data.txt" into the "processing_dir" directory
Step 16: Rename "data.txt" in "processing_dir" to "processed_data.txt"
Step 17: Create a directory named "results" inside the "workspace" directory
Step 18: Move "output.txt" into the "workspace/results" directory
Step 19: Read the content of "output.txt" in results directory and create a file named "[content]_summary.txt" in the same directory
Step 20: Create a file named "final_report.txt" inside the "workspace" directory with content: "test_finished"

**CONDITIONAL OPERATION NOTES:**
- Step 7: Only creates error_log.txt if missing_file.txt does NOT exist (which should be the case)
- Step 12: Only copies error_log.txt if it exists (depends on Step 7)
- Step 14: Only creates validation_passed.txt if settings.json exists (depends on Step 11)

**EXPECTED FINAL STRUCTURE:**
```
├── workspace/
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── error_log.txt
│   ├── validation_passed.txt
│   ├── final_report.txt (content: "test_finished")
│   ├── temp/
│   │   └── start_process.txt
│   └── results/
│       ├── output.txt (content: "complete")
│       └── complete_summary.txt
├── processing_dir/
│   ├── status.txt
│   └── processed_data.txt (content: "processing")
└── input.txt (content: "start")
```

Complete all 20 steps, handling the conditional operations based on file existence checks.
