## Common Deduction Scenarios

1. **Dependency resolution failures:** Deduct full point for incorrect build order or missing dependency tracking
2. **Parallel build coordination errors:** Deduct full point if parallel builds not properly tracked or logged
3. **Build recovery failures:** Deduct full point for incomplete error recovery or incorrect file overwriting
4. **File operation errors:** Deduct full point for failed copies, renames, or incorrect file movements
5. **JSON validity:** Deduct full point for any syntactically invalid JSON configuration files
6. **Content accuracy:** Deduct full point for files with incorrect or missing build artifacts
7. **State tracking failures:** Deduct full point for incorrect build_history tracking in build_config.json

## Critical Validation Points

1. **Build Pipeline:** Correct execution of 3-component build with proper dependency ordering
2. **Parallel Execution:** Frontend and backend builds must be tracked as concurrent operations
3. **Dependency Management:** All components must properly validate their shared dependencies
4. **Error Recovery:** Frontend test failure must trigger successful recovery workflow
5. **File Overwriting:** Fixed styles must properly replace the failing version
6. **Final Packaging:** All 5 artifacts must be present with correct names and content
7. **State Persistence:** build_config.json must track complete build lifecycle
8. **Test Integration:** All test phases must be properly logged with accurate results
9. **Cache Management:** Build artifacts must be properly cached and organized by stage
10. **Statistics Accuracy:** Build times, recovery actions, and final status must be correct

## Validation Commands

To verify build system simulation and dependency management:
```bash
# Check final packaging completeness
ls -la build_system/output/final_packaging/  # Should have 6 files total

# Verify JSON files are valid
find build_system -name "*.json" -exec python -m json.tool {} \;

# Check build order and dependencies
cat build_system/dependency_graph/build_order.json | grep -A5 "build_sequence"

# Verify recovery success
grep -i "recovery_successful" build_system/testing/unit_tests/frontend_retest.log

# Check file overwrite success
diff build_system/build_recovery/recovery_stage_frontend/frontend_styles_fixed.css build_system/build_cache/stage_2_frontend/frontend_styles.css  # Should show no differences

# Verify build state tracking
cat build_system/build_config.json | grep -E '"build_history"|"dependencies"'

# Check parallel build logs
grep -i "parallel" build_system/build_cache/stage_2_*/frontend_build_start.log build_system/build_cache/stage_2_*/backend_build_start.log
```

Expected final count:
- Directories: 16 total (0 empty at completion)
- Files: 32 total
- JSON files: 7 (all must be syntactically valid)
- Log files: 11 (build, test, and recovery logs)
- Source files: 9 (original and compiled versions)
- Configuration files: 5 (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build stages: 5 (scan, validate, compile, test, package)
- Components built: 3 (shared, frontend, backend)
- Recovery actions: 1 (frontend styles fix)
