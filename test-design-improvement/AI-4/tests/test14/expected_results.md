## Key Validation Points

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Build order must respect shared component dependencies
2. **Parallel Execution**: Frontend and backend builds must be tracked as parallel jobs
3. **Build Caching**: All compiled artifacts must be properly cached in stage directories
4. **Error Recovery**: Frontend test failure must be detected and successfully recovered
5. **File Overwriting**: Fixed styles must properly overwrite the original failing version
6. **File Renaming**: Shared components must be renamed when copied to final packaging
7. **State Tracking**: build_config.json must accurately track all build phases and history
8. **Testing Integration**: All test results must be logged with proper pass/fail status
9. **Final Packaging**: All 5 final artifacts must be present with correct content
10. **Build Statistics**: Total build time, recovery actions, and status must be accurately calculated
11. **Directory Structure**: Proper organization with 16 directories and 32 files total
12. **JSON Validity**: All JSON configuration and manifest files must be syntactically valid
