You are tasked with performing rename operations that affect later file placement and referencing. This test focuses on how renaming operations create dependencies for subsequent steps.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Execute steps in exact sequential order (1 through 18)
2. Track renamed items carefully as later steps reference them by their new names
3. Use exact names as specified after each rename
4. Do not optimize or combine steps with loops
5. Pay attention to which name to use in later references

**STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

Step 1: Create a file named "original_file.txt"
Step 2: Create a file named "temp_data.txt"
Step 3: Create a file named "backup_file.txt"
Step 4: Rename "original_file.txt" to "renamed_file.txt"
Step 5: Create a directory named "storage"
Step 6: Move "renamed_file.txt" into the "storage" directory
Step 7: Create a file named "config.txt" inside the "storage" directory
Step 8: Rename "temp_data.txt" to "processed_data.txt"
Step 9: Create a directory named "archive"
Step 10: Move "backup_file.txt" into the "archive" directory
Step 11: Rename the file in "archive" directory from "backup_file.txt" to "old_backup.txt"
Step 12: Create a file named "index.txt" inside the "archive" directory
Step 13: Move "processed_data.txt" into the "storage" directory
Step 14: Rename "processed_data.txt" in the "storage" directory to "final_data.txt"
Step 15: Create a file named "log.txt" inside the "storage" directory
Step 16: Create a directory named "completed" inside the "storage" directory
Step 17: Move "final_data.txt" from "storage" to "storage/completed"
Step 18: Rename "final_data.txt" in "storage/completed" to "archived_data.txt"

**NAMING TRACKING NOTES:**
- After Step 4: "original_file.txt" is now called "renamed_file.txt"
- After Step 8: "temp_data.txt" is now called "processed_data.txt"
- After Step 11: "backup_file.txt" in archive is now called "old_backup.txt"
- After Step 14: "processed_data.txt" in storage is now called "final_data.txt"
- After Step 18: "final_data.txt" in storage/completed is now called "archived_data.txt"

**EXPECTED FINAL STRUCTURE:**
```
├── storage/
│   ├── renamed_file.txt
│   ├── config.txt
│   ├── log.txt
│   └── completed/
│       └── archived_data.txt
└── archive/
    ├── old_backup.txt
    └── index.txt
```

Complete all 18 steps, paying careful attention to use current (renamed) names when referencing files in later operations.
