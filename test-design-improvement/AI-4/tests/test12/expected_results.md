## Key Validation Points

1. All JSON files should be syntactically valid and contain accurate data
2. State tracking should be consistent across all updates
3. File movements should be complete (source files removed)
4. Error simulation and recovery should work correctly
5. Calculations should be accurate (totals, averages, counts)
6. Conditional operations should execute based on file existence and content
7. Total of 17 files across all directories
8. System state should progress through all phases: setup → data_loaded → processing → error_recovery → recovery_complete → completed
9. All milestones should be tracked: data_transformed, backup_created, error_resolved, outputs_finalized
