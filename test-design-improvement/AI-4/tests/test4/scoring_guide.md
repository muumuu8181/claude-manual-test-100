## Scoring Notes
- Each step is scored independently
- Partial credit is not awarded for individual steps
- File/folder names and content must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- For move operations, the file must exist only in the target location (not copied)
- For rename operations, the original item must no longer exist
- All operations must maintain the correct directory structure
- Empty files are acceptable unless specific content is required
