Step 4: Create a file named "readme_v2.md" and write the text "# Beta Project" into it.

Step 5: Create a file named "config_prod.json" in the current working directory.

Step 6: Move the file "readme_v1.md" into the "project_alpha" folder.

Step 7: Move the file "readme_v2.md" into the "project_beta" folder.

Step 8: Rename the file "config_prod.json" to "settings_final.json".

Step 9: Create a file named "log_data.txt" and write the text "System startup complete" into it.
