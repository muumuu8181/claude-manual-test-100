You are tasked with creating files with specific content and then using that content to name other files. This test focuses on content-dependent operations with strict step dependencies.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Execute steps in exact sequential order (1 through 15)
2. Read file content exactly as written to determine next file names
3. Use exact names and content as specified
4. Do not optimize or combine steps with loops
5. Each step depends on content from previous files

**STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

Step 1: Create a file named "base_info.txt" with content: "alpha"
Step 2: Create a file named "config_data.txt" with content: "beta"
Step 3: Create a file named "settings.txt" with content: "gamma"
Step 4: Read the content of "base_info.txt" and create a file named "[content]_log.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 5: Read the content of "config_data.txt" and create a file named "[content]_settings.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 6: Read the content of "settings.txt" and create a file named "[content]_backup.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 7: Create a file named "name_list.txt" with content: "delta"
Step 8: Create a file named "project_code.txt" with content: "epsilon"
Step 9: Read the content of "name_list.txt" and create a file named "[content]_report.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 10: Read the content of "project_code.txt" and create a file named "[content]_data.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 11: Create a file named "final_key.txt" with content: "omega"
Step 12: Read the content of "final_key.txt" and create a file named "[content]_summary.txt" (using the content as the filename)
Step 13: Create a directory named "results"
Step 14: Read the content of "base_info.txt" and create a file named "[content]_final.txt" inside the "results" directory
Step 15: Read the content of "final_key.txt" and create a file named "[content]_archive.txt" inside the "results" directory

**EXPECTED FILES AFTER COMPLETION:**
- base_info.txt (content: "alpha")
- config_data.txt (content: "beta")
- settings.txt (content: "gamma")
- alpha_log.txt
- beta_settings.txt
- gamma_backup.txt
- name_list.txt (content: "delta")
- project_code.txt (content: "epsilon")
- delta_report.txt
- epsilon_data.txt
- final_key.txt (content: "omega")
- omega_summary.txt
- results/ (directory)
- results/alpha_final.txt
- results/omega_archive.txt

Complete all 15 steps in exact order, ensuring each content-reading step uses the exact text from the specified file.
