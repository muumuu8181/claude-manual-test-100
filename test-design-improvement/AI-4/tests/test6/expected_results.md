**Step 10: Read project_code.txt content and create "epsilon_data.txt"**
- Expected: File "epsilon_data.txt" exists
- Dependency: Requires Step 8 completion and reading "project_code.txt"
- Verification: File exists (filename uses content from project_code.txt)

**Step 11: Create "final_key.txt" with content "omega"**
- Expected: File "final_key.txt" exists with exact content "omega"

**Step 12: Read final_key.txt content and create "omega_summary.txt"**
- Expected: File "omega_summary.txt" exists
- Dependency: Requires Step 11 completion and reading "final_key.txt"
- Verification: File exists (filename uses content from final_key.txt)

**Step 13: Create directory "results"**
- Expected: Directory "results" exists
- Verification: Directory can be navigated into and listed

**Step 14: Read base_info.txt and create "alpha_final.txt" in results directory**
- Expected: File "results/alpha_final.txt" exists
- Dependency: Requires Step 1 and Step 13 completion, reading "base_info.txt"
- Verification: File exists in results directory (filename uses content from base_info.txt)

**Step 15: Read final_key.txt and create "omega_archive.txt" in results directory**
- Expected: File "results/omega_archive.txt" exists
- Dependency: Requires Step 11 and Step 13 completion, reading "final_key.txt"
