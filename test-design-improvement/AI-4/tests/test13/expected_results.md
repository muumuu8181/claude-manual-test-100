## Key Validation Points

1. **Transaction Management**: Complete transaction lifecycle with proper logging and rollback
2. **Data Consistency**: Users table and index must be properly restored after rollback
3. **Referential Integrity**: All foreign key relationships must be valid
4. **Query Execution**: Complex joins and aggregations must produce correct results
5. **Index Maintenance**: Primary and foreign key indexes must be synchronized with data
6. **State Tracking**: db_config.json must accurately track all operations and current state
7. **File Structure**: Proper organization with 13 directories and 22 files total
8. **Backup/Restore**: Transaction backup and rollback mechanisms must work correctly
9. **Integrity Validation**: All integrity check reports must validate data consistency
10. **Statistics Accuracy**: Table stats and system health must reflect actual system state
