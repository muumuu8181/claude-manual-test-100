You are tasked with creating a directory structure and files with specific dependencies between steps. Follow each step in exact order and complete all tasks.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Execute steps in exact sequential order (1 through 12)
2. Each step builds on previous steps
3. Use exact names and paths as specified
4. Do not optimize or combine steps with loops
5. Verify each step completion before proceeding

**STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

Step 1: Create a directory named "projects"
Step 2: Create a directory named "documents" inside the "projects" directory  
Step 3: Create a directory named "reports" inside the "projects" directory
Step 4: Create a directory named "archive" inside the "documents" directory (from Step 2)
Step 5: Create a directory named "templates" inside the "documents" directory (from Step 2)
Step 6: Create a file named "readme.txt" inside the "projects" directory (from Step 1)
Step 7: Create a file named "project_list.txt" inside the "documents" directory (from Step 2)
Step 8: Create a file named "monthly_report.txt" inside the "reports" directory (from Step 3)
Step 9: Create a file named "old_data.txt" inside the "archive" directory (from Step 4)
Step 10: Create a file named "template_basic.txt" inside the "templates" directory (from Step 5)
Step 11: Create a file named "summary.txt" inside the "reports" directory (from Step 3)
Step 12: Create a file named "backup_info.txt" inside the "archive" directory (from Step 4)

**EXPECTED FINAL STRUCTURE:**
```
projects/
├── readme.txt
├── documents/
│   ├── project_list.txt
│   ├── archive/
│   │   ├── old_data.txt
│   │   └── backup_info.txt
│   └── templates/
│       └── template_basic.txt
└── reports/
    ├── monthly_report.txt
    └── summary.txt
```

Complete all 12 steps and verify the final directory structure matches exactly.
