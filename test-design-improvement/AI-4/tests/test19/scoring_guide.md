**Total Points: 95 (1 point per step)**

## Scoring Criteria

### Steps 1-7: Initial Setup (7 points)
- Each directory and config file creation scores 1 point
- system_config.json must contain distributed coordination parameters

### Steps 8-20: Consensus Algorithms (13 points)
- Raft, PBFT, Paxos, Tendermint configurations must be complete
- Byzantine detection and state machine configurations required
- System config update with consensus_algorithms_configured

### Steps 21-33: Distributed Transactions (13 points)
- 2PC/3PC coordinator and participant configurations
- Saga orchestration and choreography patterns
- Vector clock and logical timestamp implementations
- System config update with distributed_transactions_configured

### Steps 34-47: Service Discovery (14 points)
- Service registry configurations (Consul, Eureka, etcd)
- Health monitoring and circuit breaker implementations
- Load balancing strategies and adaptive algorithms
- System config update with service_discovery_configured

### Steps 48-60: Cluster Management (13 points)
- Kubernetes and Nomad orchestration configurations
- Node lifecycle and cluster topology management
- Resource scheduling and quota management
- HPA and VPA auto-scaling configurations
- System config update with cluster_management_configured

### Steps 61-75: Coordination Primitives (15 points)
- Distributed locking implementations (ZooKeeper, Redis, etcd)
- Leader election algorithms (Bully, Raft, Consensus-based)

- Final system config state and completion file

## Content Requirements
- All JSON files must be valid and contain specified configurations
- System config must track state progression correctly
- Security configurations must include Byzantine fault tolerance
- Performance metrics must meet specified targets
- Operational guides must be comprehensive

## Partial Credit
No partial credit - each step is pass/fail (1 point or 0 points)
