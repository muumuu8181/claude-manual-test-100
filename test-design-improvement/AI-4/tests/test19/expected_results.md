# Test 19: Expected Results

## Step-by-Step Expected Outcomes

**Steps 1-7:** Initial directory structure and configuration
- Expected: Complete directory hierarchy and system_config.json with distributed coordination settings

**Steps 8-20:** Consensus algorithms configuration
- Expected: 4 consensus algorithm directories with complete configurations for Raft, PBFT, Paxos, and Tendermint

**Steps 21-33:** Distributed transactions setup
- Expected: Complete 2PC/3PC coordinators, saga patterns, and vector clock implementations

**Steps 34-47:** Service discovery configuration
- Expected: Consul/Eureka/etcd registries, health checking, load balancing, and circuit breaker configurations

**Steps 48-60:** Cluster management setup
- Expected: Kubernetes/Nomad orchestration, node management, resource allocation, and auto-scaling configurations

**Steps 61-75:** Coordination primitives
- Expected: Distributed locking (ZooKeeper/Redis/etcd), leader election algorithms, barrier synchronization, and message ordering

**Steps 76-85:** Security and monitoring
- Expected: Comprehensive security framework, threat modeling, distributed monitoring, and chaos engineering

**Steps 86-95:** Final integration and documentation
- Expected: Disaster recovery, performance optimization, system reports, and operational guides

## Final Verification
The completed system should demonstrate:
- 15-node distributed system with Byzantine fault tolerance
- 4 consensus algorithms with strong consistency guarantees
- Advanced coordination primitives and distributed transactions
- 99.99% availability with <1 minute recovery time
- Comprehensive security and operational excellence
